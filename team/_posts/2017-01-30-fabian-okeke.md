I am a 3rd year PhD student in the Information Science Dept, and my background is in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. My research focuses on building ubiquitous systems informed by theories from behavioral sciences. My interests include improving human productivity including time management habits, computer science education, HCI, and Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICTD).
