I'm a first-year Information Science PhD student, interested in leveraging novel technologies to solve problems in health-related domains. Particularly I'm interested in Mobile Health, Natural Language Processing and Human-Computer Interaction.

Before joining the Small Data Lab, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Tsinghua University, China.
