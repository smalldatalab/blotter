I'm doing my PhD in Behavioral Economics at the Technion under the supervision or [Ido Erev](https://web.iem.technion.ac.il/en/people/userprofile/erev.html). Since Aug 16 I'm a visiting the small data lab and collaborating on projects that bridge behavioral economics and computer science.

My hobbies include coffee breaks, drinking beer and playing poker.
