I'm Trevor's new programmer / postdoc at the [Fred Hutch](http://www.fredhutch.org/) working on [nextstrain](http://nextstrain.org) and [nextflu](http://nextflu.org), including a mixture of programming, data visualization, modeling, phylogenetics and forward prediction.

I received my BSc(hons) in mathematics from Canterbury University, New Zealand and my PhD in bacterial genomics from the [Sanger Institute](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/) (University of Cambridge) supervised by [Julian Parkhill](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/parkhill-julian) and [Nick Thomson](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/thomson-nicholas-robert). I've previously worked in virology with [Arvind Varsani](https://biodesign.asu.edu/arvind-varsani) and in RNA bioinformatics with [Paul Gardner](http://www.biol.canterbury.ac.nz/people/gardner.shtml).

During my PhD I built [phandango](https://github.com/jameshadfield/phandango), a web-based visualization tool for interpreting the genomics of bacterial populations.
