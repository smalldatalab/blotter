I am a third year Ph.D. student and AOL PhD Fellow in Computer Science Department at Cornell University and Cornell Tech. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Deborah Estrin, and be a member of the small data lab and the Connected Experiences lab. Other members in my PhD committee: Prof. Serge Belongie and Prof. Nicola Dell. My research seeks to develop algorithms to extract preference and behavioral signals from people's cross-platform online interaction records and then use them to build real-world personalized applications.
