# Abstract

Metric learning algorithms produce distance metrics that capture the important relationships among data. In this work, we study the connection between metric learning and collaborative filtering. We propose Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) that learns a joint metric space to encode not only users' preferences but also the user-user and item-item similarity. Our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithms on a wide range of recommendation tasks and is able to uncover the underlying spectrum of users' fine-grained preferences. Finally, we demonstrate that CML can achieve significant speedup for Top-K recommendation tasks through off-the-shelf approximate nearest neighbor search with negligible accuracy reduction.
