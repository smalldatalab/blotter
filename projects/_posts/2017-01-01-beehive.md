# Description
We plan to walk at least 7000 steps daily, floss regularly, work more efficiently, reduce distractions from social media,
sleep and wake up energetic, amongst hundreds of other todos. These leads to questions on what works for each person and
how can we, as humans, build on our personal preferences. We explore these kinds of questions in Beehive.

Beehive is a framework for conducting behavioral interventions by administering simple interventions to users and then monitoring the
evolution of their digital small data traces over time. This work builds on interdisciplinary techniques from Behavioral Economics, Computer Science, and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). For more information, you may contact Michael Sobolev and Fabian Okeke.
