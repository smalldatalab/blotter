title: Personalization and Immersive Recommendation
---

# Description
In this project, we leverage users' cross-platform digital traces and explore their great potentials in powering novel personalization and recommender systems. Specifically, we introduce a new user-centric recommendation model, called Immersive Recommendation, that incorporates cross-platform and diverse personal digital traces into recommendations. Our recent work includes (1) creative content recommendation with unstructured application usage traces, (2) food and restaurant recommendation with food photos, and (3) news and events recommendation with personal text data.
