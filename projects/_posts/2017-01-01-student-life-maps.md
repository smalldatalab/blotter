# Description
How often do you procrastinate? Are you right now? Do you sometimes feel like you need someone to help manage how you use
your time? Then you may find Student LifeMaps quite interesting.

Student LifeMaps (SLM) explores the effect of human coaching on the time management habits of college students. In this project, we
uncover how students vacillate between their ideal weekly plans and their realistic daily schedules, and procrastinate based on their
perceived competence level. Leveraging the power of students' small data, we integrate their daily digital location traces with their Google calendar schedules to gain deeper understanding of how they actually spend their time each week. To learn more, you may reach out to Fabian Okeke.
