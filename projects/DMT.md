title: Digital Marshmallow Test
---

# Description
The Digital Marshmallow Test is a mobile app that hopes to advance the science in identifying, understanding and, eventually, helping individuals who sometimes have difficulty regulating their behavior or act impulsively in certain situations.

The app consists of surveys and game-like tasks to understand how individuals regulate their behavior in different settings and at different times of the day. In the meanwhile, it collects sensor data such as accelerometer and screen status from the phone and correlates these passive data to users’ impulsive behavior. We build the app for both iOS and android powered by Apple’s ResearchKit(™) and Android’s ResearchStack(™) application development frameworks.
